Conventions
===========

Branch Naming
-------------

**Enhancements**
`story/{number}/{task description}`
- `{number}` should be formatted with leading zeros to 6 places (e.g. 000123)
- `{task description}` should be formatted as lowercase letters with dashes instead of spaces

**Bugs**
`bug/{number}/{task description}`
- same as enhancement format

NOTE: To start with we'll use Github's built-in issues but the long term goal would be to
use "Atoll" itself to track stories + bugs.  We'll essentially build it to boostrap itself
as early as possible in the development process.


Configuration
=============

`.browserslistrc`
  - config to let tools know what browsers we support (e.g. autoprefixer)
  - reference: https://css-tricks.com/browserlist-good-idea/

`dependency-cruiser.js`
  - config for dependency cruiser - use `npm run depgraph` to analyze project
  - reference: https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/08/23/how-to-easily-visualize-a-projects-dependency-graph-with-dependency-cruiser/

`.editorconfig`
  - general purpose config that most editors respect

`.eslintignore`
`.eslintrc.js`
  - linting configuration

`.gitignore`
  - git ignore list

`.npmrc`
  - save-exact = true means: less changes means more stability!

`.prettierrc`
  - configure prettier to match our coding style
  - reference: https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html

`.stylelintrc`
  - configure stylelint to match our coding style
  - reference: https://stylelint.io/user-guide/configuration

`babel.config.js`
  - configure babel

`i18next-scanner.config.js`
  - reference: https://github.com/i18next/i18next-scanner

`jest.config.js`
  - jest configuration

`postcss.config.js`
  - we plan on using this in future but it is currently disabled

`tsconfig.json`
  - typescript config for app when not using storybook

`tsconfig.storybook.json`
  - typescript config used by storybook

`.storybook/addons.ts`

Build Scripts
=============

`scripts/*`
  - general build scripts

`scripts/build-storybook-html.js`
  - the link between theming in the app and theming inside storybook
  - if it seems like something isn't quite working in storybook or the app that's
    related to theming you may have to take a look at what this file is doing and
    make sure it is executing correctly


NPM Scripts
===========

`test` - runs tests and enters watch mode
`test:ci` - for running tests without entering watch mode


NPM Packages

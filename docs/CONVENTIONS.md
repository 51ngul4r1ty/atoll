# Conventions

## Branch Naming

**Enhancements**
`story/{number}/{task description}`

-   `{number}` should be formatted with leading zeros to 6 places (e.g. 000123)
-   `{task description}` should be formatted as lowercase letters with dashes instead of spaces

**Bugs**
`bug/{number}/{task description}`

-   same as enhancement format

**Tech**
`tech/{number}/{task description}`

-   same as enhancement format
-   these are essentially stories with a technical flavor- e.g. "bulk up unit tests", "refactor xyz module", etc.

NOTE: To start with we'll use Github's built-in issues but the long term goal would be to
use "Atoll" itself to track stories + bugs. We'll essentially build it to boostrap itself
as early as possible in the development process.

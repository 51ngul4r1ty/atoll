Conventions
===========

Branch Naming
-------------

**Enhancements**
`story/{number}/{task description}`
- `{number}` should be formatted with leading zeros to 6 places (e.g. 000123)
- `{task description}` should be formatted as lowercase letters with dashes instead of spaces

**Bugs**
`bug/{number}/{task description}`
- same as enhancement format

NOTE: To start with we'll use Github's built-in issues but the long term goal would be to
use "Atoll" itself to track stories + bugs.  We'll essentially build it to boostrap itself
as early as possible in the development process.
